This repository contains the solutions of natural language processing challenges of Artificial Intelligence section of HackerRank.

### **Challenges:**
1. **[Basic Spell Checker](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/basic-spell-checker/problem)** - You will be provided with a Corpus of text which you can read in as a file in your program. 
Assume it is placed in the same folder as your program. Read in this text, and build up a dictionary of words and the frequencies with which those words occur. 
Your program should recommend the likeliest known word from the dictionary you built up, for each of those mistyped words. If the given word exists in your 
dictionary, output it as it is.


2. **[Byte The Correct Apple](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/byte-the-correct-apple/problem)** - The word "Apple" could generally refer to one of these two: 
     (a) Apple Inc., the great Computer giant. 
     (b) Apple, the fruit.
     You are provided a text file, with a number of lines. Each line contains either a sentence or a paragraph or a text snippet which could either be related to 
     Apple, the computer company, or the apple, the fruit. Your task is to perform disambiguation between these two groups and identify which one is being referred 
     to.
     
3. **[Compute Cross Entropy](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/nlp-compute-the-cross-entropy/problem)** - The perplexity of a bigram model is 170. 
Compute its cross-entropy corrected to 2 decimal places.


4. **[Compute the Perplexity](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/nlp-compute-the-perplexity/problem)** - The cross-entropy of a unigram model is 9.91. 
What is its perplexity?

5. **[From Paragraphs to Sentences](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/from-paragraphs-to-sentences/problem)** - You will split the chunk of text into sentences, and display one sentence per line.

6. **[Text-Processing Warmup](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/a-text-processing-warmup/problem)** - You will be given a fragment of text.
In this fragment, you need to identify the articles used (i.e., 'a', 'an', 'the').
And you also need to identify dates (which might be expressed in a variety of ways such as '15/11/2012','15/11/12', '15th March 1999','15th March 99' or '20th of March, 1999').

7. **[Trigram](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-trigram/problem)** - Given a large chunk of text, identify the most frequently occurring trigram in it.
Assume that trigrams are groups of three consecutive words in the same sentence which are separated by nothing but a single space and are case insensitive.
